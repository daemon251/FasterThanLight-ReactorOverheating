This mod adds a new mechanic to the game: Reactor overheating. Reactor overheating only applies to the player, 
and makes it so that actively powered systems and the use of systems cause heat, and if a threshold is met, power will be taken from the reactor.
Power is incrementally taken, and ranges from taxing 1 power bar to all but 1 bar of your power. More information is provided ingame.

The amount of heat dissipation is something that can upgraded.

This mod is intended to be a proof-of-concept (though it is fully functional), and may not be balanced correctly especially if ran with overhaul mods. In it's current state, it only makes the game harder.
It attempts to cut down on late-game scaling and also serves to nerf cloaking and hacking in a new way (it also makes vanilla Stealth B even worse :D).

This mod has limited compatibility with others. I will attempt to make it compatible with MV and INS+, however, issues may arise with other mods (issues can occur if the start beacon event name is different from normal).

You are free to use this idea in your mods if you wish.
